# 1 Write a program to print all the even numbers between 1 and 20, skipping the number 10 using a continue statement

for number in range(1,21):

        continue
    print(number)
    
# 2 Create a program that asks the user for numbers until they enter a negative number. Print the sum of all the positive numbers entered by the user, terminating the loop when a negative number is entered using a break statement

# 3 Write a program to find the first 5 multiples of 3, but if a multiple of 3 is divisible by 4, skip it using a continue statement

con=0

    if mux%4==0:
        num+=1
        continue
